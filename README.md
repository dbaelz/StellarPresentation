# About
Stellar Presentation is a basic presentation application for the desktop.
It's developed with [Compose for Desktop](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb) and was initially 
created as showcase for my [talk at KKON 2021](https://rheinwerk-kkon.de/programm/baelz-compose-for-desktop/).
With the provided features, it's usable for presentations and also shows different concepts of Compose for Desktop.


The app already has some useful features:
- Navigation between slides with left/right arrows and home/end keys
- Supports fullscreen (F11). Right now with a hardcoded resolution
- Template slides that make it easy to create basic presentations
- A presentation can define the typography to use

# How to use Stellar Presentation
The easiest way is to create your own presentation in a presentation-specific branch.
Also, take a look at the [sample presentation](de/dbaelz/stellar/demo/DemoPresentation.kt) and
my extensive [presentation about Compose for Desktop](https://github.com/dbaelz/StellarPresentation/tree/presentation/KKON2021-ComposeForDesktop/src/main/kotlin/de/dbaelz/stellar/demo/kkon2021)
for examples how to create presentations with the app.

# TODOs and improvement ideas
There are several todos and improvement ideas for Stellar Presentation. For example:
- Adjust/scale the slides when the presentation isn't in full screen
- Window size as command-line argument
- More default/template slides
- Export of the presentation as PDF (with screenshots)
- Extract presentations from src/main (into a Gradle module?)
- Logo for Stellar Presentation (see source code TODOs)
